    OOP(Object oriented programming):-
    
      OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriented 
    programming used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, 
    polymorphism etc in programming.The main aim of OOP is to bind together the 
    data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code 
    can access this data except that function. 

    
    Difference between object oriented and object based programming language:-
    
    1.Object-Oriented Languages (OOP) follow all the concepts of OOPs whereas, 
    Object-based languages donâ€™t follow all the concepts of OOPs like inheritance and polymorphism.
    2.Object-oriented languages do not have the inbuilt objects whereas Object-based languages have 
    the inbuilt objects, for example, JavaScript has window object.
    include VB etc.
    3.Example:-OOPs(java,python,c++),OBP(JavaScript,CSS)


    Object created programming system:-
    It is a system in which we can only create objects.we can't use these objects,
    Example:-HTML


    Difference between class and object

    Class:-
    1.It is a template which shows the behavior and functioning of an object.
    2.it is not a real world entity.
    3.It doesn't occupy memory.
    4.it is a collection of objects.
    5..Example:-Animal,Vehicles,etc.

    Object:- 
    1.It has attribute and behaviour.
    2.It is a real world entity.
    3.It occupies memory.
    4.it has three things
        a.identity(name of dog)
        b.behaviour(eat,run)
        c.attribute(age,color)
    5.Example:-Dog,car,etc.

    
    Constructor:-
    1.used to initialize te data
    2.name should same as class.
    3.it will be called automatically.
    4.special funtion create objects at the same time and initialize the object.
    5. has no return type.
